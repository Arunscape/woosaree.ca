# So you want forwarded emails eh?

Just lemme know the email address where you want to receive the emails (example: yourname@gmail.com) and the email you want others to see (example: yourname@woosaree.ca) 

Note: I don't have it set up so that you can send emails from a @woosaree.ca address, just receiving.
