# So you want a subdomain, eh?

Just lemme know what DNS records you need me to add. For example, if your website is on a server, it might be something like:

<code>A example 93.184.215.14</code>
<br/>
<code>AAAA example 2606:2800:21f:cb07:6820:80da:af6b:8b2c</code>

Which would mean that example.woosaree.ca points to the IP address 93.184.215.14


Or if your website is hosted on another website's subdomain, you might want a CNAME record like so:

<code>CNAME example example.com</code>

Which would theoretically allow someone to visit example.woosaree.ca instead of example.com
